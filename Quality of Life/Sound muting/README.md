This mod silences the most common distracting sounds in the game and includes the following:

-- Silent Vampire (aka NO SUCC - removes the Vampire suction sound);  
-- Silent Jukebox (mutes the entire Jukebox song collection);  
-- Silent Low Oxygen (removes the specific warning sounds and mutes the voicelines that play when you're low on Oxygen);  
-- No more BET-C repair sounds (screw that robot, she's the worst).

**Update v1.1 Changelog:**  
removed the Born Ready silencing as it wasn't working correctly.
