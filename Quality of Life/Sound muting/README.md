**Description:**  
contains the following sound improvements:  
-- Silent Doretta (removes the noise when that useless hunk of metal takes damage);  
-- Silent Vampire (aka NO SUCC - removes the Vampire suction sound);  
-- Silent Jukebox (mutes the entire Jukebox song collection);  
-- Personal Born Ready (makes the voicelines have 0 distance, so they're no longer global. Requires testing);  
-- Silent Low Oxygen (removes the specific warning sounds and mutes the voicelines that play when you're low on Oxygen);  
-- No more BET-C repair sounds (screw that robot, she's the worst)
