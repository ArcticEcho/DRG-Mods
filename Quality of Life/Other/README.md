**Description:**  
Thanks to @Ike for the original, this is an update of his mod.  
--In the base game when all players move more than 20 meters away from Molly, she moves to the location of the last player that left that radius.   
--This mod changes that distance to 55 meters to prevent Molly from getting in your way when you may be backing up from a fight, but if you forget to call her she wonâ€™t stay in a completely different room.   
--This mod will only apply to the lobby if the host has it.

**Update v1.01 Changelog:**  
From 75 meters to 55
