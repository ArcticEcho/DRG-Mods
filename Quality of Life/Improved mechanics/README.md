Pick one .pak only!  
\-------  
Floodlight  
Increases the reach(5x), and intensity (1.5x) of the flashlight.  
Balanced Mod  
\-------  
LaserGlow  
My best interpretation of the "Laser Sight" mod by @Banagement, updated for u34 h2. Made by request.   
Balanced Mod  
\-------  
PowerBoots  
PowerBoots increases your base walk/run speed, and the height of your jump - allowing you to spend your perks elsewhere.   
The bonus does stack with the speed related perks, so if you choose to combine them you can be sent flying - use at your own risk!   
Two versions of this mod are included, depending on your lighting preference:  
PowerBoots & Floodlight  
PowerBoots & LaserGlow  
**Unbalanced Mod**
