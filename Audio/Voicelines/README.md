**Description:**  
Removes the "Profanity" from about 75 Voicelines by clipping or changing them to other appropriate voice lines from the game. -Including "Die like your mother!" which now says "Karl would approve of this!" Should be family friendly now. Let me know if I missed anything! No subtitles "yet" and some lines might be quieter until a volume pass is done. AS REQUESTED.
