**Description:**  
When a wave attacks, mission control will get on the intercom and scream, “DA FOSSA!  DA FOSSA ARE ATTACKING!  RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!”  Audio clip taken from the first Madagascar movie.  In-game text has been changed to match as well.

## No Profanity Mod - v.9.1
**Authors:** Kraeus  
**DRG Version:** Update 34  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/a43b5953e73b91f64ecdbd257bfe418bbf8c2d8b/Audio/Voicelines/No%20Profanity%20Mod%20-%20V.9.1%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Removes the "Profanity" from about 75 Voicelines by clipping or changing them to other appropriate voice lines from the game. -Including "Die like your mother!" which now says "Karl would approve of this!" Should be family friendly now. Let me know if I missed anything! No subtitles "yet" and some lines might be quieter until a volume pass is done. AS REQUESTED.

**Update v.9.1 Changelog:**  
Moved folder locations to match Update 34.

## Rock and Stone PLUS: A Salute Mod - v.9
**Authors:** Kraeus  
**DRG Version:** Update 34  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/e49701d9738238661ec431f8594bb131eeb12724/Audio/Voicelines/Rock%20And%20Stone%20PLUS%20A%20Salute%20Mod%20-%20V.9%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Adds about 130 other voicelines from elsewhere in the game to the salutes.  
Old voice lines still play 50% to not dilute "Rock and Stone"!  
No subtitles. Works with my No Profanity Mod.  
**Sample:** https://discord.com/channels/676880716142739467/732650220214681600/834533356157927474  
**Issues:** Mod uses random cues so two players may not hear the same voiceline.  
I'll be doing a volume and attenuation pass later. DM me any issues or voiceline suggestions.
