**Description:**  
**Requires the BP Mod Manager.**  
Adds a molly paint customisation terminal to the spacerig (next to Bosco's terminal).  
You can paint Molly in 3 different "paint layers", with over 300 different materials to pick from.  
This is a client-side mod, so you'll always see your own paint customisation.  
Thanks to Ms. kitty for helping playtest the mod.

**Update v2.0 Changelog:**  
- Added 200 new materials.  
 - Added 5 customisation save slots.  
 - Added a new layer to change the material of the blinking lights.  
 - Added an optional material list that adds (50-ish) more wacky materials.  
 - Added options for which layers are randomised each mission.  
 - Improved the randomise option to now apply different paints for each molly (assuming you have multiple mollys in a mission).  
 - Fixed FPS issues in the spacerig.  
 - Fixed a bug that caused storms to break.  
 - Fixed a bug that caused molly to spawn twice if you were a client in a lobby where the host also had the mod installed.  
 - Fixed mouse sensitivity in other terminals.  
 - Fixed being able to click on hidden materials.
