## Dwarf-Sized Carve and Faster Mining - v1.0
**Authors:** BrewBreuw  
**DRG Version:** Update 33  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/5c23d01803fbe7af0465c15a6b5d9f578625a587/Gameplay/Unbalanced/Other/Dwarf-Sized%20Carve%20And%20Faster%20Mining%20-%20V1.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
- Changes carve size of nearly every material from (between 75 and 150) to 155. This gives the perfect size for making dwarf-sized tunnels to walk through.  
- Changes hits needed to mine of nearly every material from (between 3 and 5) to 1.   
- Changes carve size of gold left by a Crassus Detonator to 240, greatly speeding up crassus cleanup.  
- Does not change the carve size of bismor, umanite, red sugar, hollowmite, magnite, oil shale, engineer platforms, or "worthless" crystals. These materials don't have the "PickAxeDigSize" property and I cannot change them.  
- Does not change the hits to mine of many materials that take 2 hits. These materials don't have the "HitsNeededToMine" property and I cannot change them.  
- Inspired by the "Dirt Devil," "Safe Rocky Mountain," and "Convenient Digging" mods. This mod should not be used at the same time as those.  
- As a host, the carve size increase will affect everyone who joins your game. The reduced number of hits needed will only affect you.  
- As a client, it will try to carve a larger spot, but revert back to the normal carve size. The reduced number of hits needed will only affect you.
