## 2x Ammo And Slightly Better Scout - v1.0
**Authors:** BrewBreuw  
**DRG Version:** Update 33  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/21c2a4cea0a35c3aeffb8ec06146c007e41dac0f/Gameplay/Unbalanced/Weapons/2x%20Ammo%20And%20Slightly%20Better%20Scout%20-%20V1.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
- I wanted to use the 2x ammo mod at the same time as Slightly Better Scout, but since the two mods modify the same files, I combined them into one mod.  
- All primary and secondary weapons of all classes have their ammo doubled (doesnâ€™t affect equipment such as C4)  
- Fall damage reduction armor mod increased from 33% to 50%  
- Deepcore GK2 damage increased from 15 to 17  
- M1000 Classic clip size increased from 8 to 10, damage increased from 50 to 55  
- Zhukov Nuk17 damage increased from 12 to 14  
- Jury-Rigged Boomstick pellet count increased from 8 to 9  
- As a host, the damage & armor changes will affect anyone playing scout in your game. The ammo changes will only affect you.  
- As a client, this mod will still affect your ammo, but not damage or armor.  
*Thanks to* @imdead *for helping me make the Slightly Better Scout portion of this mod and* @GreyHound *for their work on the 2x ammo (now known as legendary hoarder) mod*
