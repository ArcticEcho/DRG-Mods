**Description:**  
- I wanted to use the 2x ammo mod at the same time as Slightly Better Scout, but since the two mods modify the same files, I combined them into one mod.  
- All primary and secondary weapons of all classes have their ammo doubled (doesn’t affect equipment such as C4)  
- Fall damage reduction armor mod increased from 33% to 50%  
- Deepcore GK2 damage increased from 15 to 17  
- M1000 Classic clip size increased from 8 to 10, damage increased from 50 to 55  
- Zhukov Nuk17 damage increased from 12 to 14  
- Jury-Rigged Boomstick pellet count increased from 8 to 9  
- As a host, the damage & armor changes will affect anyone playing scout in your game. The ammo changes will only affect you.  
- As a client, this mod will still affect your ammo, but not damage or armor.  
*Thanks to* @imdead *for helping me make the Slightly Better Scout portion of this mod and* @GreyHound *for their work on the 2x ammo (now known as legendary hoarder) mod*

## FlareRifles - v3.51
**Authors:** Potatolaser  
**DRG Version:** U33, hotfix 10  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/469fa7a185131d663590e5f4e31eba0946f8388b/Gameplay/Unbalanced/Weapons/FlareRifles%20-%20V3.51.zip)  

**Description:**  
The Flare Rifles mod changes Scout's primaries into Flare Guns, and it also changes each Flare Gun to allow for more aggressive usage (like stun and/or damage modifications), while hopefully not overshadowing the M1000 or GK2. Each one is equal to about half of one of vanilla scout's primaries in terms of potential damage dealt, and the maximum flare uptime is less than the vanilla Flare Gun's uptime (unless you take max ammo, but then all your flares are very short). The Flare Rifle has normal reload time, equip speed, and RoF, but a very short base flare time of 3 seconds.   
**Base Flare Rifle**  
MaxAmmo: 12 > 22  
**Projectile**  
Damage type: Physical  
LightIntensity: slightly decreased maybe  
Damage 40 > 54  
Duration:  75 > 3  
**Modifications**  
*MAX AMMO A*: 3 > 12  
*CLIP SIZE B*: 1 > 4  
*ROF B*: 3 > 5  
*STUN*: +100% chance to stun on any hit, or...  
*+HEAT*: add 50% of the damage as heat  
*SPIKY GRENADE*: +60 damage (no explosives involved)  
*AMMO C*: 3 > 45  
*DURATION C*: 15 > 18  
Note:  Please set the “prevent latejoin character duplication” option to TRUE, as if a scout joins without the mod he will have two vanilla flare guns (with a worse flare duration)

**Update v3.51 Changelog:**  
Adjusted some values so that now the flare rifle can one shot grunts to the head. Updated Readme Slightly

## Grenade Rework - v1.0
**Authors:** Our Lord And Savior Gabe Newell

--**Plasma Bursters** have slightly larger AoE, more damage, more armor break, can't be thrown as far, detonate up to 15 times once per second while gradually increasing in detonation speed, only deal 35% FF (used to be 100%), hold 2.  
--**LUREs** have way more health but can take friendly fire damage, last up to 20s, hold 3, decent damage to nearby enemies.  
--**Cluster Grenades** instantly deploy 32 bomblets, 50 damage each, increased AoE, bomblet spread is massive, bomblets no longer detonate on impact but after 5s, hold 2.  
--**Incendiary Grenades** do massive damage to weak targets very quickly, last 20s, slightly larger area, hold 2.  
--**Sticky Grenades** now do the bulk of their damage to the stuck target on impact, throw farther, smaller AoE and damage, hold 8.  
--**Axes** no longer primarily do AoE damage, now they do entirely melee damage and get large bonus damage from hitting weakspots.  Still powerful.  
--**Neurotoxin Grenades** deal damage faster, more damage, slow enemies to 50% speed, debuff lasts 15s, cloud lasts 20s, hold 2.  
--**High Explosive Grenades** have reduced damage (68), carve out a 6.5m area, detonate within 0.5 seconds, throw farther, have higher armor break and hold 8.

## High Quality GK2 - v1.1
**Authors:** BongoSkaggs  
**DRG Version:** U34 H1  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/c75a370d781cf6dc6bee7efca68417286da1b19d/Gameplay/Unbalanced/Weapons/High%20Quality%20GK2%20-%20V1.1%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Adjustments to make the GK2 less bland.  
Base weapon changes.  
-Increased base RoF from 7 to 12.25.  
-Increased base magazine size from 25 to 35.  
-Increased base max ammo from 375 to 385.  
-Increased base stun chance from 10% to 20%.  
-Removed weakpoint requirement from stun.  
Upgrade changes.  
-T1.2 RoF upgrade increased from +2 to +3.5.  
-T2.1 Damage upgrade increased from +2 to +3.  
-T2.2 Max Ammo upgrade decreased from +100 to +75.  
-T3.2 Damage upgrade increased from +1 to +2.  
-T3.3 Magazine Size upgrade increased from +10 to +15.  
-T4.1 Weakspot Damage upgrade swapped with T5 upgrade 'Battle Frenzy.'  
-T4.3 RoF upgrade increased from +2 to +3.5.  
-T5.1 upgrade 'Battle Frenzy' swapped with T4.1 Weakspot Damage.  
-T5.3 upgrade 'Stun' replaced with +75 Max Ammo upgrade.  
Overclock changes.  
-Compact Ammo magazine size bonus increased from +5 to +10.  
-Gas Rerouting RoF bonus increased from +1 to +1.75.  
-Overclocked Firing Mechanism RoF bonus increased from +3 to +5.25.  
-Bullets of Mercy magazine size penalty increased from -5 to -15.  
-AI Stability Engine RoF penalty increased from -2 to -3.5.  
-AI Stability Engine damage penalty increased from -2 to -3.  
-Electrifying Reload magazine size penalty increased from -5 to -15. (Shares a file with Bullets of Mercy)  
These adjustments dramatically improve the GK2s DPS output, bringing it much closer to the M1000, while retaining its middling sustained fire capabilities.  
Additionally the vertical recoil of the weapon becomes much more significant. Improving the gunplay along with providing players a potential reason to give a damn about accuracy upgrades & OCs.

**Description:**  
Bring along double the ammo & double clip size for every weapon in the game. All support tools had their ammo increased or otherwise received a buff.

## Scout for Bug Planet - v1
**Authors:** PastoSeco14  
**DRG Version:** U33  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/b76090ccd94a9b3fddc13469be0459b3eeb92c36/Gameplay/Unbalanced/Weapons/Scout%20For%20Bug%20Planet%20-%20V1%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Since hazard mods like "Bug Planet Constant Conflict" add a lot of enemies I rebalanced the scout weapons to be competent against the large waves of alien spiders, this mod may seem to be broken at first but remember it was made to face the (at least for me), hardest hazard mod available: Bug Planet (also play it with custom enemy cap set on 200)  
Changes  
GK2 Assault Rifle:   
This one is more powerful, so you'll have granted protection against lots of enemies and big enemies but you'll run out of ammo if you dont prioritize nitra  
Damage 15 -> 18  
Max Ammo 350 -> 550  
Magazine Size 25 -> 50  
RoF 7 -> 12  
Reload Time 1.8 -> 1.4  
Weakpoint Bonus 10% -> 20%  
M1000  
This one will cause a lot more damage, so if you are lucky you can waste 1 bullet per grunt and use the extra ammo to kill as many glyphids as you can, also you can defend yourself against large enemies such as opressors, praetorians, etc to keep the fight against the lots of grunts (one shot grunts not guaranteed)  
Damage 50 ->100  
Max ammo -> 144  
Magazine Size 8 -> 12  
RoF 4 -> 5  
Reload time: 2.5 -> 2  
Weak Point Bonus 10% -> 30%  
Armor breaking 30% -> 80%  
Shotgun or "DOOMstick"  
Idk if this was done before but the sawed shotgun now acts like the supershotgun from DOOM Eternal, with only one shot per shell you get twice the damage and a fast reload so you can kill as fast as you can, i recommend it for close quarters, a lot of grunts close form each others and fast kills of big enemies, also the shotgun jump doesnt seem very affected since the reload time is very fast  
Damage 12 -> 24  
Pellets 8 -> 16  
Shock wave AoE damage 20 -> 40  
Max Ammo -> 44 (maybe i should reduce it)  
Mag Size 2 -> 1  
Rof 1.5 -> 5  
Reload time 2 -> 1  
Im running out of space to write lol, this mod adds fun things, give it a try 😉

--- Adds 5min long electric arc turrets  
--- 2min. long unbreakeable luries  
--- 10 Luries  
--- 2x ammo for breach cutter  
--- Increased Breach cutter damage  
Notes: **Recallable Minigun Turrets** is a mod made by @Our Lord And Savior Gabe Newell, **you should try that one and the other mods that he has published **!, (I modified his mod to make the sentry build time way less longer)   
This mod was made up keeping in mind the @Sesselpots's Bug Planet Constant Conflict mod gameplay, so it works pretty good killing large hordes of grunts, if you use it in vanilla Hazards this mod will be extremely OP  
Handle with caution, you can accidentally kill teammates while using this, so you should never forget to recall your turrets to deactivate the electric arc
