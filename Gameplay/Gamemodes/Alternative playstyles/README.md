## Bulk Power Shift - v1.1
**Authors:** Potatolaser  
**DRG Version:** U33  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/c6b296a445a7f5e59d695a190cad5b991261e721/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Alternative%20playstyles/Bulk%20Power%20Shift%20-%20V1.1.zip)  

**Description:**  
Reduces the damage of the bulk death explosion from 20,000 to 3,000, while increasing the damage of its normal attack from 80 to 534 (that last part's optional). The decreased death explosion damage will still one-shot a doretta section and players (although they might survive in the escape pod more reliably now). The purpose of this mod is to offset the fact that exploding a bulk on a dreadnought no longer requires any timing. Now includes a version without the normal attack damage boost, as the reduced death explosion damage already doesn't help dwarves in most situations.

**Update v1.1 Changelog:**  
Added a version of the mod without an attack boost.

## Dreadnought Buffs - v3.5
**Authors:** Potatolaser  
**DRG Version:** U34  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/700d913ca98b31e77651be62fdfc5dd0da6114f2/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Alternative%20playstyles/Dreadnought%20Buffs%20-%20V3.5.zip)  

**Description:**  
Buffs the dreadnoughts! There's a lot of general changes like a bit more health, damage, speed, knockback, and they’re slightly harder to freeze; but the Big Ones are:  
**OG DREAD**- Faster fireballs, larger aoe slam radius, eggshots spawn extra swarmers, zap you, and have a large aoe OR damage upgrade  
**HIVEGUARD**- Slower sentinel goo, faster turn radius. Two versions with lots of fireball carve and aoe radius OR movespeed and bite damage  
**TWINS**- Rockwave attack knockback boost, arbalest mines make you really cold really quickly OR they explode really quickly and damage you  
    If you don’t like those OR statements, there are now EX versions that just do all of those things!

**Update v3.5 Changelog:**  
Returned hiveguard turnspeed to vanilla values, as it was sometimes causing issues with projectile hit registration if everyone didn't have the mod

Hoxxes IV seems to be running low on masks, so the cave leeches have been instructed to improve their social distancing. Cave leeches will enthusiastically buzz around you, but *almost* certainly will not be able to grab you (and if one does, please send me a clip!)

## Support Pods - v1.1
**Authors:** Our Lord And Savior Gabe Newell  
**DRG Version:** Update 33  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/4cc16cdb57ec25575f71f4c74b6e608e89ce69ab/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Alternative%20playstyles/Support%20Pods%20-%20V1.1%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
**Requires the Blueprint Mod Manager.**  
Adds 5 new call ins to the game. The beginning of the game provides you with 3 charges shared between all pods, these charges refresh every 5 minutes and it costs 1 charge per pod. Only the host with the mod can call these in to prevent de-sync issues as a client trying to call them in.  
‣ Spotpipe: when you press 6 a beacon is placed to call in a pod with a rotating spotlight that provides bright light around it and directional light on the ceiling, it also comes with 4 pipeline starts to start grinding on any mission you want (except refinery to prevent breaking the mission).  
‣ Time Capsule: when you press 7 a beacon is placed to call in a pod that has 4 deposit slots for collecting your precious minerals regardless of MULE accessibility. This works on every mission type, yes, even Point Extraction and Refinery. Comes with spinning MULE beacon to light the way and tell your ears to find it later.  
‣ Angelic Intervention: when you press 0 a late joining player beacon is placed and an egg falls from the sky, opening shortly after with your favorite pet. That's right, Steeve! Nah, who wants that when you can get your very own personal flying taxi to explore any cave you want . .  
‣ Low Gravity Generator: when you press F1 a beacon is placed to call in a carriable battery that generates low gravity in a large area as well as gives a 30% speed boost to allies and enemies alike.  Stacks with multiple batteries by each other for even lower gravity.  
‣ Defense Generator: when you press F3 a beacon is placed to call in a carriable battery that gives 50% damage reduction for enemies and allies alike in a large area.  Does not stack with multiple batteries.  
Known bugs: late joining players can see over-sized call ins.

**Update v1.1 Changelog:**  
Added movable magic hole and magic crystal buffs from Azure Weald to F1 and F3.  
F1 is low gravity, 30% speed boost for 15s and it stacks with additional buff objects (crate batteries) to jump higher and fall slower, which also affects enemies.  
F3 is 50% damage reduction for 15s and it affects enemies too.

## The Real Krampus - v1.0
**Authors:** The Inevitable Luke  
**DRG Version:** Update 34, Hotfix 5  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/d2642929d3b82f0d155c4b9898675184df559b79/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Alternative%20playstyles/The%20Real%20Krampus%20-%20V1.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Krampus Detonators aren't particularly helpful. The Real Krampus makes them actively **un**helpful

## Upgraded Doretta - v1.4
**Authors:** Our Lord And Savior Gabe Newell  
**DRG Version:** U34 H5  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/c67962adbd456dd4864c4c3e52781edc53369a33/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Alternative%20playstyles/Upgraded%20Doretta%20-%20V1.4%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
**Requires the Blueprint Mod Manager.**  
Management finally decided it was worth upgrading the Drilldozer to prevent future losses!  Oh, who am I kidding, of course they didn't.  
‣ We welded 4 heavy LMG turrets to Doretta with as much ammo as a standard turret magazine and provided no reserves, so stick your engineer with reloading them since his personal turret doesn't stay onboard anyways, unlike these ones.  
‣ Cut some holes for 2 deposits near the gears that make the Drilldozer do what it is known for, drilling; thus helping you to crush those minerals and hopefully not break the damn thing.  
‣ Got rid of some suspension to add 2 pipeline starts to the back end of the treads. Who would have thought that a giant artificial tunnel system would be good for roller-coasters AND extraction with a valuable head and the glowing duct tape equivalent of Hoxxes?  
‣ You'd think that with all this oil shale we could at least afford to power some better lighting for this marvelous piece of engineering.  With the help of aftermarket sources, we were able to use the spinning of the drill to power up a repurposed floodlight.  
‣ At the cost of sandwich storage, we were able to make Doretta stronger than wet tissue paper in some of Hoxxes's more deadly cave systems.  We estimate that these changes should make her at least 50% stronger than her lesser counterpart.  
‣ Taking notes from previous worlds, we have decided that taking the slag produced by oil shale can be a valuable asset at slowing things down.  We may or may not have compromised the structure in turn for some utility.

**Update v1.4 Changelog:**  
prevented pipelines from spawning on Refinery missions to prevent mission softlocks if a Doretta is spawned.
