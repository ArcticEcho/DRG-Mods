## Bulk Power Shift - v1.1
**Authors:** Potatolaser  
**DRG Version:** U33  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/c6b296a445a7f5e59d695a190cad5b991261e721/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Alternative%20playstyles/Bulk%20Power%20Shift%20-%20V1.1.zip)  

**Description:**  
Reduces the damage of the bulk death explosion from 20,000 to 3,000, while increasing the damage of its normal attack from 80 to 534 (that last part's optional). The decreased death explosion damage will still one-shot a doretta section and players (although they might survive in the escape pod more reliably now). The purpose of this mod is to offset the fact that exploding a bulk on a dreadnought no longer requires any timing. Now includes a version without the normal attack damage boost, as the reduced death explosion damage already doesn't help dwarves in most situations.

**Update v1.1 Changelog:**  
Added a version of the mod without an attack boost.

**Description:**  
Buffs the dreadnoughts! There's a lot of general changes like a bit more health, damage, speed, knockback, and they’re slightly harder to freeze; but the Big Ones are:  
**OG DREAD**- Faster fireballs, larger aoe slam radius, eggshots spawn extra swarmers, zap you, and have a large aoe OR damage upgrade  
**HIVEGUARD**- Slower sentinel goo, faster turn radius. Two versions with lots of fireball carve and aoe radius OR movespeed and bite damage  
**TWINS**- Rockwave attack knockback boost, arbalest mines make you really cold really quickly OR they explode really quickly and damage you

**Update v3.3 Changelog:**  
Updated Hiveguard and Hiveguard EX files so hopefully it doesn’t crash clients who don’t have the mod when it does the rock phase. Also gave the carve hiveguard +1 fireball damage, instead of leaving that value vanilla. Made all the fleshy bits have 0.95 explosive resistance instead of 0.9/0.9/0.95

**Description:**  
--Changes all player base health from 110 to 25, all player shields from 25 to 250 to replicate max player health without affecting upgrades.  
--Shield recharge rate does not scale, so it takes a long time to recover your shields and there is no reliable way to get your shields back outside of Shield Link.  
--Includes all combos of laser sight, air control, 2x, 3x flashlights and this shield and health swapping.

**Description:**  
Hoxxes IV seems to be running low on masks, so the cave leeches have been instructed to improve their social distancing. Cave leeches will enthusiastically buzz around you, but *almost* certainly will not be able to grab you (and if one does, please send me a clip!)

## Support Pods - v1.1
**Authors:** Our Lord And Savior Gabe Newell  
**DRG Version:** Update 33  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/4cc16cdb57ec25575f71f4c74b6e608e89ce69ab/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Alternative%20playstyles/Support%20Pods%20-%20V1.1%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
**REQUIRES MOD LOADER**  
Adds 3 new call ins to the game. The beginning of the game provides you with 3 charges shared between all pods, these charges refresh every 5 minutes and it costs 1 charge per pod. Only the host with the mod can call these in to prevent de-sync issues as a client trying to call them in.  
-Spotpipe: when you press 6 a beacon is placed to call in a modified resupply pod with a rotating spotlight that provides bright light around it and directional light on the ceiling, it also comes with 4 pipeline starts to start grinding on any mission you want (except refinery to prevent breaking the mission). This pod is also worth kicking.  
-Time Capsule: when you press 7 a beacon is placed to call in a modified supply pod that has 4 deposit slots for collecting your precious minerals regardless of MULE accessibility. This works on every mission type, yes, even Point Extraction and Refinery. Comes with spinning MULE beacon to light the way and tell your ears to find it later. Despite my on-the-spot name for this, it does not actually hold stuff for later, just an alternative deposit area.  
-Angelic Intervention: when you press 0 a late joining player beacon is placed and an egg falls from the sky, opening shortly after with your favorite pet. That's right, Steeve! Nah, who wants that when you can get your very own personal flying taxi to explore any cave you want . .  
Known bugs: late joining players can see over sized call ins.

**Update v1.1 Changelog:**  
Added movable magic hole and magic crystal buffs from Azure Weald to F1 and F3.  
F1 is low gravity, 30% speed boost for 15s and it stacks with additional buff objects (crate batteries) to jump higher and fall slower, which also affects enemies.  
F3 is 50% damage reduction for 15s and it affects enemies too.

## Upgraded Doretta - v1
**Authors:** Our Lord And Savior Gabe Newell  
**DRG Version:** Update 33  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/ef646ed72ccfef8de9aa1d3e2c98f430c9a48cdb/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Alternative%20playstyles/Upgraded%20Doretta%20-%20V1%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
REQUIRES MOD LOADER  
Management finally decided it was worth upgrading the drilldozer armor to prevent future losses!  Oh, who am I kidding, of course they didn't.  
-We welded 4 heavy LMG turrets to Doretta with as much ammo as a standard turret magazine and provided no reserves, so stick your engineer with reloading them since his personal turret doesn't stay aboard anyways, unlike these ones.  
-Cut some holes for 2 deposits near the gears that make the drilldozer do what it is known for, drilling, thus helping you to crush those minerals and hopefully not break the damn thing.  
-Got rid of some suspension to add 2 pipeline starts to the bottom, outer sides of the fuel canister region.  Who would have thought that a giant artificial tunnel system would be good for roller-coasters AND extraction with a valuable head and the glowing duct tape equivalent for Hoxxes?  
Note-> does not pimp your ride (adds stuff, nothing was actually removed for the enhancements).
