## Hazard 6 - v3.4
**Authors:** Ike  
**DRG Version:** Update 33 Hotfix 8  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/da90d057c967e709101286b55aa0f329cb9c5425/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Hazard%20Levels/Hazard%206%20-%20V3.4%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
This comprehensive Hazard 6 Mod  
--This replaces the Hazard 5 file so it isn't compatible with other mods that do the same  
--The in-game and steam/discord status will update to say Hazard 6. Rewards multiplier is set to 166%.  
--The amount of enemies, enemy diversity, enemy speed, damage, and a host of other factors are all scaled up to be consistent with scaling in the base game hazards. A full list of changes can be found here -> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ygMn4sHAx0jvgRK0qa9LAOIcETnznkh1MtVLgsfu0ik/edit?usp=sharing  
--A description of variables and the philosophy of why some were scaled more and some less is here -> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O2hmVsoaSy2qId4jCWOP_pHMXaoGMWqf_MY7RAs6cxI/edit?usp=sharing  
--In addition to the hazard file this mod also modifies the resupply file so it only costs 60 nitra. This is to prevent failstates from bad nitra RNG early in certain levels and prevent an ammo meta as enemy number and health scale up.   
--This mod also gives Doretta about 50% more health to counteract increased danger from diverse, numerous, and powerful enemies. She still can die, but this prevents that from being the only likely failstate.   
--Only the host needs the mod to spawn enemies and affect difficulty elements. If clients don't have the mod they will not receive additional rewards, show 'Haz6' on their steam/discord status message, they will spend 80 nitra to drop resupplies, and their Doretta UI will be messed up.   
--Changes since V2.0 include:  
-Special enemies like spitters and swarmers have an easier time spawning  
-Enemies do a little more damage to make scaling more consistent with base game hazards and counteract the difficulty reduction from special enemy spawn frequency  
-There is much more variance mission to mission in all difficulty elements

**Update v3.4 Changelog:**  
corrected doretta file for hotfix (again)

**Description:**  
——————  
One、mod content introduction  
There are two packages, which are the same except for different translations [ check “Hell's trial ground（The second half of the article）”]  
   This is a new game experience "mod"  
    The main content of mod, divided by type, is roughly divided into :  
【Hazard 8/9】【60 Nitra】【110 Cap】【Weapons and Perks Adjustment 】  
Hazard 9 and 8 are two integrated "mods" that are the same except for difficulty  
    As you can see, this mod is different from most of the others, This mod was created by considering more of the game's elements, so it has many types of conten, with the weapon stats being the biggest change, it will bring more intensive combat and more challenging  
    Detailed changelog, please check in the compressed package  
Hazard 9 is my design goal, Hazard 8 is just for beginners, not for design purposes, so it's best to play Hazard 9  
——————  
Two、mod design goal  
    1. Consider the game elements in the introduction comprehensively, focusing on the combat scenario  
    2. Focus on teamwork,change direction of 4 classes for 4 players  
    3. More enemies,increased enemy strength,and improved some weapon stats to get more intense combat and more challenging new difficulty【Kill the enemy faster to get the fiercer fight】  
    4. Moderate enemy Wave interval  
    5. make the adjusted weapons as far as possible to maintain balance,enhance the weapon collocation of unpopular,add new weapon collocation  
    6. Give up small upgrades and Overclocks for the bigger picture

    8. other contents of the change idea is the same  
    9. One more word.In order to improve the game experience of Scout, he was identified as a key concern in Hazard 9.for now,his fighting ability is good, But save your teammate first

## Hell's trial ground（The second half of the article） - v1.0
**Authors:** lpap  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotfix 7  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/00fb8e9575bb2e5d41f11b008f7fa3594da2ce9b/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Hazard%20Levels/Hell%27s%20Trial%20Ground%EF%BC%88The%20Second%20Half%20Of%20The%20Article%EF%BC%89%20-%20V1.0.zip)  

**Description:**  
I as the old in the hardcore players, all of the changes in content, according to my own game experience and some basic calculation, no depth calculation, Limited ability, plus the limitation of some game mechanics, So the weapon balance is mediocre, difficulty Settings are ok, but it was enough, you have some doubts about these changes, this is normal  
——————  
Three、This mod has too much content, In order to avoid conflict with other mod, please remove the "mod" of the following type  
（Change the difficulty of Hazard 5）（Enemy cap）（Nitra Supply Pod）（weapons）（Perks）  
——————  
four、In order to improve the game experience for four players and maintain game balance, please pay attention to and do as much as possible the following two points, though not necessary condition  
   “Hell's trial ground” mod has changed the weapon stats to fit the Hazard 9 difficulty for a more enjoyable combat experience. Most weapon stats have been enhanced  
    1. All 4 players must have this mod :    Due to the influence of the game mechanics,Homeowners can share the difficulty of the mod, but only some of the attributes of the weapons in the mod are shared, can the passenger plane get all the weapon attributes of the mod, so this is directly related to the game experience of the passenger plane, I am also very helpless about this question  
    2. 4 players each choose 4 classes  
“Hell's trial ground” mod casually share to other players, also in order to alleviate these problems  
——————  
This is mod I made with my current understanding of games, you may find it difficult at the beginning, please try more  
This mod May be disabled due to the game's "hotfix", Or I updated it, Please Constant concern discord  
The two mod packages are the same except for the language translation

## Starship Troopers - v33.2.3
**Authors:** NaturalBornCamper  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotfix 2  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/7367056ebad041b952ad0a09bf010a1b5902c043/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Hazard%20Levels/Starship%20Troopers%20-%20V33.2.3.zip)  

**Description:**  
For people who don't like Haz5's bullet sponge enemies, but find Haz4 too easy.  
Similar to my "Increased enemies" mod, but a bit different as I wasn't satisfied, this mod brings Haz4 enemies into Haz5 (speed, damage resistance, etc) with double the enemy count of Haz5, to give you a Starship Troopers-like feeling with massive hordes of enemies while still rewarding 133% XP since the difficulty feels pretty much the same.  
Haz3 is just 150% more enemies without change to their stats as they are already very much soft.

\----------------------------------------------------------------  
--Haz3 150% enemies (125% on single player)  
--Haz4 150% enemies (125% on single player)  
--Haz5 200% enemies (150% on single player)  
\----------------------------------------------------------------  
Note: Escort mission double flying rocks can be overwhelming, so I included optional mods to decrease their health  
Note: Replaces Haz 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5 and 5.5. Only the host needs the mod  
Note: You can use the mod "Cheaper resupplies" with 60 nitra if you are having ammo problems, but 80 is still ok  
NOTE: YOU DON'T NEED "Custom Cap" mod, but if you want to use it anyways, you might crash on first launch. Let me know if you have issues and I'll remove it or figure something out

**Update v33.2.3 Changelog:**  
Added Hazard name in Haz3/Haz4, Adds Difficulties for DD/EDD, includes enemy cap (SEE NOTE ABOVE)

## Starship Troopers Elite - v33.7.4
**Authors:** NaturalBornCamper  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotfix 7  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/68e09c813fefcb0d7a22a2c6b199323e66b011a0/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Hazard%20Levels/Starship%20Troopers%20Elite%20-%20V33.7.4%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
FOR VETERANS OF MY REGULAR STARSHIP TROOPERS MOD, this mod triples the spawn size.  
Regular Haz5 swarms vary a lot and some maps can have very little spawns. That won't happen with this mod, swarms will pretty much be as large as the enemy cap you put.  
You will always have intense maps so you need to stay ahead of your ammo and prioritize nitra!!  
The enemies still have Haz4 specifications (speed, damage, resistance, ..) as regular Starship Troopers, but everything else is Haz5 (friendly fire, revive health, etc)  
I HIGHLY recommend using the mod that improves doretta armor so you can focus on enemies instead of babysiting a drill.

## Twice the enemies Haz 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5 (Missions + Deep Dives) - v33.10.1
**Authors:** NaturalBornCamper  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotfix 10  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/abcd98f07bc61dd2f67915cb9eb4ae1fbc5eb54b/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Hazard%20Levels/Twice%20The%20Enemies%20Haz%203%2C%203.5%2C%204%2C%204.5%2C%205%2C%205.5%20%28Missions%20%2B%20Deep%20Dives%29%20-%20V33.10.1.zip)  

**Description:**  
This mods simply and only make the game spawn more enemies without changing anything else. This means swarms will be larger, swarmer nests will shoot more swarmers, brood nexus will pop more swarmers, etc  
This is as close to vanilla as possible, so you can expect normal game behavior apart from the increased spawn. Also makes normal Deep Dive fun again, less boring 😉

\----------------------------------------------------------------  
--Higher enemy count for an alternate higher difficulty, spawning more enemies instead of making them tougher.  
--Variation 2x has 200% enemies (150% enemies single player)  
--Variation 1.5x has 150% enemies (125% enemies single player)  
--No XP boost or any other modification, this is just for fun  
--Use obviously the multiplier file you choose, not both  
--Replaces Haz 3, 4, 5 and DD/EDD. Only the host needs the mod  
--IMPORTANT: Use EITHER the "xxx_cap" file ALONE or the regular file along with ArcticEcho's "Custom Cap" mod (300 enemies, 120 swarmers)  
\----------------------------------------------------------------  
NOTES:  
-Escort mission double flying rocks can be overwhelming, I recommend the mod to reduce their health by 50%  
-You should use the mod to improve Doretta's damage resistance by 50% (as you will be busy with enemies)  
-You can use the mod "Cheaper resupplies" with 60 nitra if you're having ammo problems, but 80 is still ok

**Update v33.10.1 Changelog:**  
Removed bundled enemy cap and other mods to remove confusion
