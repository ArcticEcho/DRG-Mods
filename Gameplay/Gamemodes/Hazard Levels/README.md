**Description:**  
This replaces Hazard 1 with Hazard 0, which is intended for picture taking and testing.   
--No enemies spawn in waves or at the beginning of the map. Not too much different from Haz1.

--Sets all hazard difficulty factors that scale to player number to what they would be in a 4-player lobby regardless of player count  
--This includes enemy count, health, and damage.

## Hazard 5.5 - v1.0
**Authors:** Ike  
**DRG Version:** Update 33  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/44a4cc454f95bea8e70efcc505a6599e764b8c73/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Hazard%20Levels/Hazard%205.5%20-%20V1.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
--Replaces the hazard 5 file, and is not compatible with other mods that do the same.  
--Sets the values to what they are in Hazard 5.5 the last stage of the EDD  
--Compared to Haz5 this means slightly increased enemy speed and damage, as well as more fall damage.  
--Should show Haz5.5 in game.  
--Per request to add some challenge to viewer spawns since enemy amount isn't affected but enemy stats are.

## Hazard 6 - v3.3
**Authors:** Ike  
**DRG Version:** Update 33 Hotfix 7  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/5c533c48780f49ee11204929185d1be43e2a48b1/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Hazard%20Levels/Hazard%206%20-%20V3.3%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
This comprehensive Hazard 6 Mod  
--This replaces the Hazard 5 file so it isn't compatible with other mods that do the same  
--The in-game and steam/discord status will update to say Hazard 6. Rewards multiplier is set to 166%.  
--The amount of enemies, enemy diversity, enemy speed, damage, and a host of other factors are all scaled up to be consistent with scaling in the base game hazards. A full list of changes can be found here -> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ygMn4sHAx0jvgRK0qa9LAOIcETnznkh1MtVLgsfu0ik/edit?usp=sharing  
--A description of variables and the philosophy of why some were scaled more and some less is here -> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O2hmVsoaSy2qId4jCWOP_pHMXaoGMWqf_MY7RAs6cxI/edit?usp=sharing  
--In addition to the hazard file this mod also modifies the resupply file so it only costs 60 nitra. This is to prevent failstates from bad nitra RNG early in certain levels and prevent an ammo meta as enemy number and health scale up.   
--This mod also gives Doretta about 50% more health to counteract increased danger from diverse, numerous, and powerful enemies. She still can die, but this prevents that from being the only likely failstate.   
--Only the host needs the mod to spawn enemies and affect difficulty elements. If clients don't have the mod they will not receive additional rewards, show 'Haz6' on their steam/discord status message, they will spend 80 nitra to drop resupplies, and their Doretta UI will be messed up.   
--Changes since V2.0 include:  
-Special enemies like spitters and swarmers have an easier time spawning  
-Enemies do a little more damage to make scaling more consistent with base game hazards and counteract the difficulty reduction from special enemy spawn frequency  
-There is much more variance mission to mission in all difficulty elements

**Update v3.3 Changelog:**  
corrected doretta file for hotfix (again)

--Beating this is possible, and using other buffs is cheating, but I would recommend staying inside the drop pod at the start of refinery missions.

## Hazard 9- Freeme（and Hazard 8） - v1.0
**Authors:** lpap  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotfix 7  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/7bfad1bda7fd37b4a69ad390877c022eb15b1361/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Hazard%20Levels/Hazard%209-%20Freeme%EF%BC%88and%20Hazard%208%EF%BC%89%20-%20V1.0.zip)  

**Description:**  
Hazard 9 is my design goal, Hazard 8 is just for beginners, not for design purposes, so it's best to play Hazard 9  
——————  
   One、Hazard 8/9 mod content introduction  
   This is a new game experience "mod"  
    The main content of mod, divided by type, is roughly divided into :  
【Hazard 8/9】【60 Nitra】【110 Cap】【Weapons and Perks Adjustment 】  
Hazard 9 and 8 are two integrated "mods" that are the same except for difficulty  
    As you can see, this mod is different from most of the others, This mod was created by considering more of the game's elements, so it has many types of conten, with the weapon stats being the biggest change  
    Detailed changes, please check in the compressed package  
——————  
If I follow this game in the future, I'll keep updating the Hazard 8/9 mod  
This is something I made with my current understanding of games, you may find it a little difficult at the beginning, please try more  
Hazard 8/9 May be disabled due to the game's "hotfix", Or I updated it, Please Constant concern discord  
The following two compressed packages in addition to language translation is different, the rest of the content is the same  
Because the word limit is exceeded, I put the other content in the “attention points”, there are some things that must be paid attention to, please be sure to check

## Starship Troopers - v33.2.1
**Authors:** NaturalBornCamper  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotfix 2  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/e20cc3962fb2f7d5887314e30bec24a01ecd6ec1/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Hazard%20Levels/Starship%20Troopers%20-%20V33.2.1.zip)  

**Description:**  
For people who don't like haz5's bullet sponge enemies, but find haz4 too easy.  
Similar to my "Increased enemies" mod, but a bit different as I wasn't satisfied, this  
mod makes Haz5 enemies same as Haz4 (speed, damage resistance, etc) with double the enemy  
count of HAZ5, to give you a Starship Troopers-like feeling with massive hordes of Haz4  
enemies while still rewarding 133% XP since the difficulty feels pretty much the same.

\----------------------------------------------------------------  
--Haz4 150% of Haz5 enemies (125% on single player)  
--Haz5 200% of Haz5 enemies (150% on single player)  
\----------------------------------------------------------------  
Note: Escort mission double flying rocks can be overwhelming, so I included optional mods to decrease their health  
Note: Replaces Haz 4, and 5. So it won't work with Haz 6/7. Only the host needs the mod  
Note: Use "Ludicrous Cap" or "Custom Cap" mod to avoid enemy de-spawn  
Note: Included optional 60 Nitra ressuply mod

**Update v33.2.1 Changelog:**  
Added Hazard name change in game and updated description

## Twice the enemies Haz 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5 (Missions + Deep Dives) - v33.2.1
**Authors:** NaturalBornCamper  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotfix 2  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/1befa52fb69d8a9085273df209c0afc5a6045cb2/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Hazard%20Levels/Twice%20The%20Enemies%20Haz%203%2C%203.5%2C%204%2C%204.5%2C%205%2C%205.5%20%28Missions%20%2B%20Deep%20Dives%29%20-%20V33.2.1.zip)  

**Description:**  
Who doesn't feel ecstatic when throwing an explosive into a swarm of aliens and hearing  
40+ simultaneous cries of pain? Want gigantic hordes of cannon fodder?  
This is as close to vanilla as possible, so you can expect normal game behavior, only  
with twice the enemies. Also makes normal Deep Dive fun again, less boring 😉

\----------------------------------------------------------------  
--Higher enemy count for an alternate higher difficulty, spawning tons of enemies instead of less but tougher enemies like haz6/7.  
--Variation 2x has 200% enemies (150% enemies single player)  
--Variation 1.5x has 150% enemies (125% enemies single player)  
--No XP boost or any other modification, this is just for fun  
--Use obviously the multiplier file you choose, not both  
\----------------------------------------------------------------  
Note: 2x escort mission flying rocks is too much, so I included optional mods where they have 50% or 35% health  
Note: Replaces Haz 3, 4, 5 and DD/EDD. So it won't work with Haz 6/7. Only the host needs the mod  
Note: Recommended using "Custom Cap" mod to avoid enemy de-spawn. 150 normal enemies and 100 swarmers
