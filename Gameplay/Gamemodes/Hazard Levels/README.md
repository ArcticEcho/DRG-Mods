**Authors:** Ike

--Compared to Haz5 this means slightly increased enemy speed and damage, as well as more fall damage.

## Hazard 6 - v3.0
**Authors:** Ike  
**DRG Version:** Update 33  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/681a20964db829bbcd44ab1adc840b8157570b53/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Hazard%20Levels/Hazard%206%20-%20V3.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
This comprehensive Hazard 6 Mod  
--This replaces the Hazard 5 file so it isn't compatible with other mods that do the same  
--The in-game and steam/discord status will update to say Hazard 6. Rewards multiplier is set to 166%.  
--The amount of enemies, enemy diversity, enemy speed, damage, and a host of other factors are all scaled up to be consistent with scaling in the base game hazards. A full list of changes can be found here -> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ygMn4sHAx0jvgRK0qa9LAOIcETnznkh1MtVLgsfu0ik/edit?usp=sharing  
--A description of variables and the philosophy of why some were scaled more and some less is here -> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O2hmVsoaSy2qId4jCWOP_pHMXaoGMWqf_MY7RAs6cxI/edit?usp=sharing  
--In addition to the hazard file this mod also modifies the resupply file so it only costs 60 nitra. This is to prevent failstates from bad nitra RNG early in certain levels and prevent an ammo meta as enemy number and health scale up.   
--This mod also gives Doretta about 50% more health to counteract increased danger from diverse, numerous, and powerful enemies. She still can die, but this prevents that from being the only likely failstate.   
--Only the host needs the mod to spawn enemies and affect difficulty elements. If clients don't have the mod they will not receive additional rewards, show 'Haz6' on their steam/discord status message, they will spend 80 nitra to drop resupplies, and their Doretta UI will be messed up.   
--Changes since V2.0 include:  
-Special enemies like spitters and swarmers have an easier time spawning  
-Enemies do a little more damage to make scaling more consistent with base game hazards and counteract the difficulty reduction from special enemy spawn frequency  
-There is much more variance mission to mission in all difficulty elements

--Beating this is possible, and using other buffs is cheating, but I would recommend staying inside the drop pod at the start of refinery missions.  
--Works well with expanded enemy cap mods.

## Starship Troopers - v33.2.1
**Authors:** NaturalBornCamper  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotfix 2  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/e20cc3962fb2f7d5887314e30bec24a01ecd6ec1/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Hazard%20Levels/Starship%20Troopers%20-%20V33.2.1.zip)  

**Description:**  
For people who don't like haz5's bullet sponge enemies, but find haz4 too easy.  
Similar to my "Increased enemies" mod, but a bit different as I wasn't satisfied, this  
mod makes Haz5 enemies same as Haz4 (speed, damage resistance, etc) with double the enemy  
count of HAZ5, to give you a Starship Troopers-like feeling with massive hordes of Haz4  
enemies while still rewarding 133% XP since the difficulty feels pretty much the same.

\----------------------------------------------------------------  
--Haz4 150% of Haz5 enemies (125% on single player)  
--Haz5 200% of Haz5 enemies (150% on single player)  
\----------------------------------------------------------------  
Note: Escort mission double flying rocks can be overwhelming, so I included optional mods to decrease their health  
Note: Replaces Haz 4, and 5. So it won't work with Haz 6/7. Only the host needs the mod  
Note: Use "Ludicrous Cap" or "Custom Cap" mod to avoid enemy de-spawn  
Note: Included optional 60 Nitra ressuply mod

**Update v33.2.1 Changelog:**  
Added Hazard name change in game and updated description

## Twice the enemies Haz 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5 (Missions + Deep Dives) - v33.2.1
**Authors:** NaturalBornCamper  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotfix 2  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/1befa52fb69d8a9085273df209c0afc5a6045cb2/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Hazard%20Levels/Twice%20The%20Enemies%20Haz%203%2C%203.5%2C%204%2C%204.5%2C%205%2C%205.5%20%28Missions%20%2B%20Deep%20Dives%29%20-%20V33.2.1.zip)  

**Description:**  
Who doesn't feel ecstatic when throwing an explosive into a swarm of aliens and hearing 40+ simultaneous cries of pain?  
Want gigantic hordes of cannon fodder?  
I created this mod as a middle ground between haz 4 and haz 5 when playing with low level friends so they can have more  
fun while not getting insta-killed by tough enemies. Also makes normal Deep Dive fun again, less boring 😉

\----------------------------------------------------------------  
--Higher enemy count for an alternate higher difficulty, spawning tons of enemies instead of less but tougher enemies like haz6/7.  
--Variation 2x has 200% enemies (150% enemies single player)  
--Variation 1.5x has 150% enemies (125% enemies single player)  
--No XP boost or any other modification, this is just for fun  
--Use obviously the file you choose, not both  
\----------------------------------------------------------------  
Note: 2x escort mission flying rocks is too much, so I included optional mods where they have 50% or 35% health  
Note: Replaces Haz 3, 4, 5 and DD/EDD. So it won't work with Haz 6/7. Only the host needs the mod  
Note: Recommended using "Custom Cap" mod to avoid enemy de-spawn
