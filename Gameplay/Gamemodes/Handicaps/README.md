## Buffed-C - v1.3
**Authors:** Potatolaser  
**DRG Version:** Update 34  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/acc885ae43c5b5b82df0333e6ca55e10ea340493/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Handicaps/Buffed-C%20-%20V1.3.zip)  

**Description:**  
Ever fought a Bet-C and thought to yourself, “Man, that sure was a fast “bossfight””. Well now with this mod, BetC might last for more than 30 seconds! Buffed-C has:  
-more HP (1300 > 2925 per parasite)  
-faster grenades?  
-a faster Lock on time (0.25 > 0.2)  
-can shoot from farther away (2500 > 5000)  
-fire grenades a bit faster (0.5 > 0.7)  
-fire *many* grenades faster during special attack (0.5 > 0.1)  
-and explode grenades slightly sooner (1.5 > 1.4)  
These changes help Buffed-C do what Bet-C does, but a little better. If these changes don’t sound like they do enough, there’s also the EX version!  
-special starts sooner (2 > 0.4)  
-can shoot significantly sooner (0.25 > 0.1)  
-fires significantly more grenades (0.5 > 1.7)  
-burst cooldown reduced (0.8 > 0.4)  
-explode grenades even sooner (1.4 > 1.0)  
Also includes a few QoL fixes, like repairing Buffed-C in less time (8 > 4) and doing a bit less friendly fire damage (0.08 > 0.02 & 0.05 > 0.02).

## Cave Leech Clusterfuck - v1.2
**Authors:** The Inevitable Luke  
**DRG Version:** U34 H5  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/3360ab54e2ace18e53cd5b5a579299b4807314e1/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Handicaps/Cave%20Leech%20Clusterfuck%20-%20V1.2%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Do you feel like Cave Leech Clusters need more leeches? Do you think leeches are too big, or too slow? Do you have a nuisance Scout you're looking to dispose of? Look no further - Cave Leech Clusterfuck is the mod for you!  
--Makes smaller, faster leeches  
--Makes a *lot* more leeches (but only in missions with the modifier)  
--Renames *Cave Leech Cluster* to *Cave Leech Clusterfuck* in mission selection  
--Increases hazard bonus  
--May not behave quite right on all mission types (Refinery has been... odd so far)

**Update v1.2 Changelog:**  
Improved cave leech tessellation. Fewer opportunities to see that pesky "ceiling" that used to appear between our glorious overleeches. **Accept the leech. Love the leech.**

## Hardended Weakness - v1.0
**Authors:** mino  
**DRG Version:** U33 H10  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/bc5a179dd9a9d06be91de699bb048a394bb6dc27/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Handicaps/Hardended%20Weakness%20-%20V1.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Turns the mutator anomaly 'Critical Weakness' into the opposite. Instead of increasing the damage to weakpoints by 5x from the usual 2x or 3x it turns the spots into hardened shells which only take 0.5x damage. This makes it possible to have two negative mutators at once as it still counts as anomaly not a warning. It also doesn't increase the payout it just the challenge. Refer to the DRG wiki how this mutator usual works and which parts are affected on which creature: https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Mutators#Critical_Weakness & https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Creatures . This works only as host but for everyone who joins (no mod manager / not blueprinted).

**Description:**  
Increases the normal enemy cap from 60->240 and swarmer cap from 60->240. Use this if the Custom Enemy Cap mod is not updated.

## No Reviving - v2
**Authors:** Shrub_Daddy  
**DRG Version:** 33  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/2b8f0abe2b1828325f53dc456cdc207841af30b5/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Handicaps/No%20Reviving%20-%20V2%20_P.pak)

## Smooth Fustercluck Bulks - v1.0
**Authors:** Our Lord And Savior Gabe Newell  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotfix 9  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/3493580518410a176390ad6615ab6a39ad53e9f8/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Handicaps/Smooth%20Fustercluck%20Bulks%20-%20V1.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
--Makes bulks have speed increases based on hazard (should work for clients).  
--Bulks no longer make a crater where they explode (still hurts), but they send out 32 bomblets with 10m carve radius of super smooth terrain.  This means that the center point is a mountain with a massive crater around it that sucks to traverse.  
--Bulks have double health and a radioactive green glow.  
--Bulks now stay frozen for longer so that you might be able to counter this terrifying version.  
--Bulks now do significantly more friendly fire damage, so they can probably kill just about anything with ground slams.  
--Bulk bomblets now do 50% less damage and have lower minimal damage.  
Other changes from the original were not transferred due to file changes.  Can make the awful terrain version again but only if someone asks.
