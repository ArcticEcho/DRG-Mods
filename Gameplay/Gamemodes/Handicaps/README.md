## Candy Van Leeches - v1
**Authors:** Shrub_Daddy  
**DRG Version:** Update 33. Hotfix 10  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/e917397a5c6a776c47b296a6c9255144d8d8f255/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Handicaps/Candy%20Van%20Leeches%20-%20V1%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Makes Cave Leeches move insanely fast  
-- Instant grabbing  
-- 200 Meter grab distance  
-- No delay  
-- No lowering you down if it's killed  
Note that this makes leeches incredibly unfair as they will yoink you before you can even shoot them likely  
Why did I make this? Cause why not?

## Cave Leech Clusterfuck - v1.0
**Authors:** The Inevitable Luke  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotfix 9  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/65b21d62d06df26bf961dff056eabf1350e7a9c7/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Handicaps/Cave%20Leech%20Clusterfuck%20-%20V1.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Do you feel like Cave Leech Clusters need more leeches? Do you think leeches are too big, or too slow? Do you have a nuisance Scout you're looking to dispose of? Look no further - Cave Leech Clusterfuck is the mod for you!  
--Makes smaller, faster leeches  
--Makes a *lot* more leeches (but only in missions with the modifier)  
--Renames *Cave Leech Cluster* to *Cave Leech Clusterfuck* in mission selection  
--Increases hazard bonus  
--May not behave quite right on all mission types (Refinery has been... odd so far)

## Hardended Weakness - v1.0
**Authors:** mino  
**DRG Version:** U33 H10  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/bc5a179dd9a9d06be91de699bb048a394bb6dc27/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Handicaps/Hardended%20Weakness%20-%20V1.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Turns the mutator anomaly 'Critical Weakness' into the opposite. Instead of increasing the damage to weakpoints by 5x from the usual 2x or 3x it turns the spots into hardened shells which only take 0.5x damage. This makes it possible to have two negative mutators at once as it still counts as anomaly not a warning. It also doesn't increase the payout it just the challenge. Refer to the DRG wiki how this mutator usual works and which parts are affected on which creature: https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Mutators#Critical_Weakness & https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Creatures . This works only as host but for everyone who joins (no mod manager / not blueprinted).

## No Reviving - v2
**Authors:** Shrub_Daddy  
**DRG Version:** 33  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/2b8f0abe2b1828325f53dc456cdc207841af30b5/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Handicaps/No%20Reviving%20-%20V2%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Makes it literally impossible to revive, excluding FM and IW. (Works on both U32 & 33)

## Smooth Fustercluck Bulks - v1.0
**Authors:** Our Lord And Savior Gabe Newell  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotfix 9  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/3493580518410a176390ad6615ab6a39ad53e9f8/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Handicaps/Smooth%20Fustercluck%20Bulks%20-%20V1.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
--Makes bulks have speed increases based on hazard (should work for clients).  
--Bulks no longer make a crater where they explode (still hurts), but they send out 32 bomblets with 10m carve radius of super smooth terrain.  This means that the center point is a mountain with a massive crater around it that sucks to traverse.  
--Bulks have double health and a radioactive green glow.  
--Bulks now stay frozen for longer so that you might be able to counter this terrifying version.  
--Bulks now do significantly more friendly fire damage, so they can probably kill just about anything with ground slams.  
--Bulk bomblets now do 50% less damage and have lower minimal damage.  
Other changes from the original were not transferred due to file changes.  Can make the awful terrain version again but only if someone asks.

**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/bc5bb217b7e6d692481115ffcb2a41528a4cea2a/Gameplay/Gamemodes/Handicaps/Warmer%20Swarmers%20-%20V1%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Makes swarmers no longer die if they are frozen
