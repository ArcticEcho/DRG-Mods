## Custom Waves - v1.4
**Authors:** ArcticEcho  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotifx 6  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/a822a01a4174c1de2f511549a34eedcf26093bbe/Gameplay/Customizable%20tweaks/Custom%20Waves%20-%20V1.4%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
**Requires the mod loader.**  
This mod adds a new customisable wave system to the game, it doesn't replace the "natural" in-game waves. The mod uses a spawn cost and spawn chance system to make wave compositions feel more natural and varied. Every enemy is assigned a spawn chance that determines its rarity (higher number = higher chance to spawn), and a spawn cost that determines how expensive that enemy type is to spawn (higher number = less units spawn per wave). Each wave is made up of multiple "stages", where each stage will spawn a group of enemies on a random player (at a set distance).

**Update v1.4 Changelog:**  
Fixed a minor conflict with the generous management mod.

## Generous Management - v2.0
**Authors:** ArcticEcho  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotifx 4  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/98eebae77830a1d2edf4515d13eb6bc1b8a31b4a/Gameplay/Customizable%20tweaks/Generous%20Management%20-%20V2.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
**Requires the mod loader.**  
This mod has two main features: it can drop in broken resupplies when enemies spawn, allowing you to stay in a mission indefinitely without running out of ammo; and it can replace normal resupply drops with several broken pods, because why not.  
I've also modified the broken resupplies to deal the same drop damage as regular pods, and reduced their repair time and resupply time to help keep them from feeling too tedious:  
 - Drop Damage: 50 -> 1000  
 - Damage Radius: 150 -> 20cm  
 - Repair Duration: 20 -> 1.75 secs  
 - Resupply Duration: 4 -> 2 secs  
 - Coop Build Bonus: 25 -> 100%  
**Update 2.0**  
 - Updated mod for U33.  
 - Added an option to control the minimum pod spawn distance.  
 - Pods no longer drop on/near downed teammates.  
 - Pods no longer drop inside of eachother/increased space between them.  
 - The mod no longer despawns pods spawned by other mods.
