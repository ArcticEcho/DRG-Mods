## Better Time Control - v1.1
**Authors:** Buckminsterfullerene  
**DRG Version:** U34H5  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/85bdf75b29ccbaaa3c296b75156ddb680ca05906/Gameplay/Customizable%20tweaks/Better%20Time%20Control%20-%20V1.1%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
**Requires Blueprint Mod Manager.** Allows you to adjust the game's time dilation to between 0 and 8 (any higher and your FPS is reduced to rubble). Use any key bindings of your choice (by default, `Numpad +` & `Numpad -`) to increase and decrease the time dilation, so that you can change the values without having to open the menu!

**Update v1.1 Changelog:**  
Added the ability to edit key bindings from the mod menu.

## Custom Enemy Cap - v2.7

**Description:**  
**Requires the BP Mod Manager.**  
Displays the number of enemies in game, and lets you control the global enemy cap (and can optionally lower the cap depending on your FPS). The cap only applies when hosting.

**Update v2.7 Changelog:**  
Fixed the enemy counter not showing up.

## Custom Waves - v1.4
**Authors:** ArcticEcho  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotifx 6  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/a822a01a4174c1de2f511549a34eedcf26093bbe/Gameplay/Customizable%20tweaks/Custom%20Waves%20-%20V1.4%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
**Requires the Blueprint Mod Manager.**  
This mod adds a new customisable wave system to the game, it doesn't replace the "natural" in-game waves. The mod uses a spawn cost and spawn chance system to make wave compositions feel more natural and varied. Every enemy is assigned a spawn chance that determines its rarity (higher number = higher chance to spawn), and a spawn cost that determines how expensive that enemy type is to spawn (higher number = less units spawn per wave). Each wave is made up of multiple "stages", where each stage will spawn a group of enemies on a random player (at a set distance).

**Update v1.4 Changelog:**  
Fixed a minor conflict with the generous management mod.

## Environmentalist - v3.1
**Authors:** ArcticEcho  
**DRG Version:** Update 33  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/6450d4296b8ff471c1535a452545520018ad3a7a/Gameplay/Customizable%20tweaks/Environmentalist%20-%20V3.1%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
**Requires the Blueprint Mod Manager.**  
Make Hoxxes even more unwelcoming with a selection of controls to spawn in earthquakes and storms. This is a host-side mod.

## Generous Management - v2.0
**Authors:** ArcticEcho  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotifx 4  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/98eebae77830a1d2edf4515d13eb6bc1b8a31b4a/Gameplay/Customizable%20tweaks/Generous%20Management%20-%20V2.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
**Requires the Blueprint Mod Manager.**  
This mod has two main features: it can drop in broken resupplies when enemies spawn, allowing you to stay in a mission indefinitely without running out of ammo; and it can replace normal resupply drops with several broken pods, because why not.  
I've also modified the broken resupplies to deal the same drop damage as regular pods, and reduced their repair time and resupply time to help keep them from feeling too tedious:  
- Drop Damage: 50 -> 1000  
- Damage Radius: 150 -> 20cm  
- Repair Duration: 20 -> 1.75 secs  
- Resupply Duration: 4 -> 2 secs  
- Coop Build Bonus: 25 -> 100%
