## BBP (Big Balance Patch) - v1.7
**Authors:** GreyHound  
**DRG Version:** U33 Hotfix 9  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/af7827651b0d5ea6689e898c1ee834d9f63804f6/Gameplay/Balanced/BBP%20%28Big%20Balance%20Patch%29%20-%20V1.7.zip)  

**Description:**  
Pretty much overhauls your entire DRG gameplay experience. The changelog is too long to post here, so it has been included in the zip file. Also features a PDF changelog option.  
Notes:   
1. Changes will fully work only if the lobby host has the mod installed, otherwise any damage changes will be ignored and set to vanilla.  
2. Do not use it with any mods that alter the weapons' base values (ammo, damage etc.); perks and grenades have been altered as well, so are utility tools and armor mods. I'm not responsible for your crashes should you choose to ignore this;)  
    This mod includes a rework of the PGL, extensive changes to Zhukovs/Subata/Warthog/Autocannon/Breach Cutter and buffs to underperforming OCs/weapons/perks/grenades along with nerfs to overperforming ones.  
    Note on shield generator changes: there is currently a bug where the duration upgrades apply twice. In order to "fix" this, I halved them so the values actually match what's written in the files. This is a temporary solution and will be reverted once GSG fixes the issue.

**Update v1.7 Changelog:**  
included in the doc/pdf with entries under (v1.7) in bold or underlined/bolded in case it was an update to an earlier change.
