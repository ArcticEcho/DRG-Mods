**Description:**  
Happy to see buffs to the HE grenade, this is an update to an old version thatI made to give the grenade a more distinct identity.  
--Damage falloff is minimal.  
--Damage radius is reduced by .3 meters.  
--The fuse is reduced from 1.7 seconds to .5 seconds.  
--Throw speed is increased by 50%.

**Description:**  
Major overhaul of the game's weapon balance. This includes dozens and dozens of changes to weapons, the mods/OCs, perks, grenades, secondary equipment, armour...  
Warning: the mod is incompatible with all other balance mods!  
Changelog is included in the zip file, in docx and pdf variants. I've also included author comments for most of the changes and added a honourable mentions section to the changelog.

**Update v1.8.1 Changelog:**  
corrected the added info for GK2's Floating Barrel and Gyro Stabilisation (turns out they're both bugged) and buffed Supercooling Chamber's focus shot damage bonus.

## BBP Submod - Sawed Off OCs - v1.1
**Authors:** GreyHound  
**DRG Version:** U33 Hotfix 4  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/aada66406d0300875000c9c006263221d0da7a21/Gameplay/Balanced/BBP%20Submod%20-%20Sawed%20Off%20OCs%20-%20V1.1%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
This mod changes Double Barrel into an Unstable OC in function: x1.5 damage per pellet, x2.5 spread (replaces previous effects, no longer shoots two barrels at once). Special Powder is now a Balanced OC in principle as it gains a -2 damage per pellet penalty.

**Update v1.1 Changelog:**  
Reworked the penalty files used for the new Double Barrel effect, I can now manually edit them without affecting any other OCs. Damage bonus changed to x1.75, spread penalty reduced to x2.25.

## Excavation Grenade - v2.0
**Authors:** Ike  
**DRG Version:** 34 H1  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/ad52b909dacc017c532a8f1cf14a2ed604680d3d/Gameplay/Balanced/Excavation%20Grenade%20-%20V2.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Happy to see buffs to the HE grenade, this is an update to an old version that I made to give the grenade a more distinct identity and provide an alternative to TCF. Mineral physics from U34 still apply to this.  
--Damage is reduced to 20.  
--Carve diameter is tripled.  
--The fuse is reduced from 1.7 seconds to .5 seconds.  
--Throw speed is increased by 50%.  
--Grenade count is increased to 8.  
--This allows you to mine minerals or clear terrain easily, but it still works to clear up groups of swarmers or jellies with minimal risk of friendly fire.  
--Mod Demonstration (outdated physics)->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaACo-2Io3o&ab_channel=AGlyphidisFineToo  
--This mod will only apply to the lobby if the host has it.
