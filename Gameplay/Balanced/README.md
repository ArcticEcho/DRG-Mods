**Description:**  
Happy to see buffs to the HE grenade, this is an update to an old version thatI made to give the grenade a more distinct identity.  
--Damage falloff is minimal.  
--Damage radius is reduced by .3 meters.  
--The fuse is reduced from 1.7 seconds to .5 seconds.  
--Throw speed is increased by 50%.  
--This makes it an on demand explosive damage weapon to compete with axes. It has just enough to one shot mactera spawns and slashers so it's great for those.

**Authors:** GreyHound  
**DRG Version:** U34 Hotfix 5  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/7cba86ad695fe028c30bd2f4b162dbd81768461a/Gameplay/Balanced/BBP%20Submod%20-%20Overclock%20Redesign%20-%20V1.3%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
This mod changes a few specific overclocks that were deemed too bland and boring, or needed spicing up to be actually different from their counterparts. The intention is to get rid of "here's more damage/ammo OC whose penalties can be easily counteracted" and make the OCs actually change the weapon usage somewhat.  
Zhukovs: added +1 Blowthrough to Gas Recycling.  
BRT:  
Experimental Rounds now adds +40% weakspot damage instead of flat 9 damage;  
Compact Mags: loses all previous bonuses, instead gains +24 mag size, +2 RoF, x1.25 spread per shot and x1.5 spread, codenamed Burst Fire PDW;  
Minigun:  
Leadstorm OC gains +1 Blowthrough instead of +4 damage;  
Compact Feed Mechanism gains +15 RoF and +200% Heat Generation instead of +800 ammo (true 400) and -2 RoF, codenamed Annihilator;  
EPC: Magnetic Cooling Unit now adds +5 normal shot damage instead of the x0.75 heat buildup when charged bonus.  
Homebrew Powder: on Bulldog now grants +10 damage, becomes a clean upgrade in principle; on Subata adds +2 damage;   
Assault Rifle's HP has been reworked into Magnum Rounds: +1 Penetraion, -3 RoF, x1.75 Recoil, -160 Ammo. Unstable OC in principle, Blowthrough doesn't show up on the weapon card but it works;  
Chain Hit: adds +15 ammo on Subata; adds +8 ammo on Bulldog.

**Update v1.3 Changelog:**  
added Just War (crimes) - adds 3 clipsize, a 100% chance to Neurotoxin afflicted targets; in return, AoE damage is reduced by 35 and -1 AoE radius (former Compact Rounds); added Ratling Gun (former Exhaust Vectoring) - inspired by Yarby's design, now adds +40% movement speed, +150 ammo and x3 spread.

**Description:**  
Happy to see buffs to the HE grenade, this is an update to an old version that I made to give the grenade a more distinct identity and provide an alternative to TCF. Mineral physics from U34 still apply to this.

--Carve diameter is tripled.  
--The fuse is reduced from 1.7 seconds to .5 seconds.  
--Throw speed is increased by 50%.

--This allows you to mine minerals or clear terrain easily, but it still works to clear up groups of swarmers or jellies with minimal risk of friendly fire.  
--Mod Demonstration (outdated physics)->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaACo-2Io3o&ab_channel=AGlyphidisFineToo  
--This mod will only apply to the lobby if the host has it.

## Freezing Hell (Minigun OC) - v1.1
**Authors:** Yarby  
**DRG Version:** U34 H5  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/17f922e9b54ea5fcf6c7a0d9169b41133c77968c/Gameplay/Balanced/Freezing%20Hell%20%28Minigun%20OC%29%20-%20V1.1%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
These high-tech bullets are designed to devastate frozen enemies and convert into cryo-minelets that will super-cool anything that comes close after impacting the terrain. However they don't last forever and the rounds themselves take more space in the drum and deal less direct damage. Additionally, these super-cooled rounds will reduce the heat output of the minigun chamber. This replaces the Bullet Hell overlock.  
Cryo-minelets deal 4 cold damage and have 0 arming delay  
+300% damage on frozen enemies  
+0.8 cooling rate  
-4 damage  
-400 ammo

**Update v1.1 Changelog:**  
Buffed damage vs frozen enemies.

**Description:**  
--Lootbugs and Huuli Hoarders now drop minerals as fast and as much as you can damage them before killing them (high RoF low damage is best).
