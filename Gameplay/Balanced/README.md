Happy to see buffs to the HE grenade, this is an update to an old version thatI made to give the grenade a more distinct identity.  
--Damage falloff is minimal.  
--Damage radius is reduced by .3 meters.  
--The fuse is reduced from 1.7 seconds to .5 seconds.  
--Throw speed is increased by 50%.

## Excavation Grenade - v2.0
**Authors:** Ike  
**DRG Version:** 34 H1  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/ad52b909dacc017c532a8f1cf14a2ed604680d3d/Gameplay/Balanced/Excavation%20Grenade%20-%20V2.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Happy to see buffs to the HE grenade, this is an update to an old version that I made to give the grenade a more distinct identity and provide an alternative to TCF. Mineral physics from U34 still apply to this.  
--Damage is reduced to 20.  
--Carve diameter is tripled.  
--The fuse is reduced from 1.7 seconds to .5 seconds.  
--Throw speed is increased by 50%.  
--Grenade count is increased to 8.  
--This allows you to mine minerals or clear terrain easily, but it still works to clear up groups of swarmers or jellies with minimal risk of friendly fire.  
--Mod Demonstration (outdated physics)->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaACo-2Io3o&ab_channel=AGlyphidisFineToo  
--This mod will only apply to the lobby if the host has it.

**Description:**  
--Lootbugs and Huuli Hoarders now drop minerals as fast and as much as you can damage them before killing them (high RoF low damage is best).

--Seems to prevent them from dropping loot on death since you ring them dry through torture.

A mod adressing minigun mod tree balance issues, namely accuracy, blow-through and magnetic bearings mods.

Also buffs magnetic bearings effect to give a reason for its existence. https://discord.com/channels/676880716142739467/732650220214681600/835268920473681970
