**Description:**  
No, this is not a cheat, I just decided not to bundle it with other mods anymore to reduce confusion.  
This is a sub-mod, to use with the mods Starship Troopers, Bug planet, increased enemy spawn where the amount of flying rocks during the second stage of Escort missions can be overwhelming.  
\----------------------------------------------------------------  
--Variation 0.5 has 50% health  
--Variation 0.35 has 35% health  
--Variation 0.25 has 25% health  
\----------------------------------------------------------------

**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/9c77d3abd203ee52182ff8bfd295653824f7ad30/Gameplay/Misc/Fabulously%20Fast%20Lootbugs%20-%20V1%20_P.pak)

## Good Old Bet-C.exe - v33.2.0
**Authors:** NaturalBornCamper  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotfix 2  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/b76ccc71de1d2cfc5ceaf69fa73bca1e70a287f6/Gameplay/Misc/Good%20Old%20Bet-C.exe%20-%20V33.2.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Prevents friendly BET-C from hurling bombs in your face and taking out your shield.  
Basically uses Left 4 Dead AI principles; if not smart enough to avoid hitting you,  
then at least it won't damage you. Just like good old times before update 20-something.  
No more needing to re-consider repairing BET-C or not on shield disruption missions.   
\----------------------------------------------------------------  
--Friendly BET-C bombs do 0 damage on dwarves  
\----------------------------------------------------------------

## Improved Doretta Armor - v33.9.0
**Authors:** NaturalBornCamper  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotfix 9  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/61cdd545b7387b43df9e18b5088252b39f496a0e/Gameplay/Misc/Improved%20Doretta%20Armor%20-%20V33.9.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Management finally invested and replaced Doretta's wet paper armor  
This is not for cheating, it's a sub mod specifically made for high hazard mods, like Starship Troopers, Bug Planet and 1.5x/2x enemies (But incompatible with Haz6/7), where Doretta missions can be nearly impossible with the huge amount of flying rocks and enemies keeping you busy from defending her.  
It basically gives Doretta 50%/75% damage resistance over all enemy attacks, so her health won't go down as fast if you took a babysitting break to mine nitra and can't make it back in time.  
\-------------------------------------------------------  
--Only host needs the mod, will not break the Doretta health UI on clients  
--I did not change the friendly fire damage or environmental damage as it seems balanced  
--Gives Doretta 50% or 75% Enemy damage resistance, according to the variation you use  
--I recommend using 50% on Starship Troopers  
--I recommend using 75% on Starship Troopers Elite  
--NOTE: Will probably crash if you use it with the "Upgraded Doretta" mod

**Update v33.9.0 Changelog:**  
Updated for Update 33, Hotfix 9, updated description and name

**Description:**

**Description:**  
**Requires the Mod Loader**  
--Adds three toggles in the mod loader to enable Christmas, Halloween and a custom map setup made by me.  
--Visually and audibly works as a client regardless of what the host has (I left this in on purpose, could disable it while not the host), all three options work well for clients while you are the host.  
--Good for snowball fights if you turn on my custom map edits (extra snow).  Will add some more custom festive stuff and config saving in the future, just wanted to get this functional version out so it seems like I do stuff.
