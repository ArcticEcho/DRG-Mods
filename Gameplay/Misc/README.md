## Doretta 50% Enemy Damage Resistance - v33.9.0
**Authors:** NaturalBornCamper  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotfix 9  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/efc4face425153a0b4db0eb005febe8b43c2c1bc/Gameplay/Misc/Doretta%2050%25%20Enemy%20Damage%20Resistance%20-%20V33.9.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Management finally invested and replaced Doretta's wet paper armor with cartboard!  
Specifically made for high hazard mods, like Starship Troopers, Starship Troopers Elite, Bug Planet, Bug Planet Constant Conflict and 1.5x/2x enemies (But incompatible with Haz6/7), where Doretta missions can be nearly impossible, especially with the huge amount of flying rocks and enemies keeping you busy from defending her.  
It basically gives Doretta 50% damage resistance over all enemy attacks, so her health won't go down as fast if you went mining nitra and can't make it back in time haha.  
I don't think I will include this mod in Starship Troopers as most people will probably want the real deal.  
\-------------------------------------------------------  
--Only host needs the mod, will not break the doretta health UI on clients  
--I did not change the friendly fire damage or environmental damage as it seems balanced

## Good Old Bet-C.exe - v33.2.0
**Authors:** NaturalBornCamper  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotfix 2  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/b76ccc71de1d2cfc5ceaf69fa73bca1e70a287f6/Gameplay/Misc/Good%20Old%20Bet-C.exe%20-%20V33.2.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Prevents friendly BET-C from hurling bombs in your face and taking out your shield.  
Basically uses Left 4 Dead AI principles; if not smart enough to avoid hitting you,  
then at least it won't damage you. Just like good old times before update 20-something.  
No more needing to re-consider repairing BET-C or not on shield disruption missions.   
\----------------------------------------------------------------  
--Friendly BET-C bombs do 0 damage on dwarves

**Description:**  
**Requires the Mod Loader**  
--Adds three toggles in the mod loader to enable Christmas, Halloween and a custom map setup made by me.  
--Visually and audibly works as a client regardless of what the host has (I left this in on purpose, could disable it while not the host), all three options work well for clients while you are the host.  
--Good for snowball fights if you turn on my custom map edits (extra snow).  Will add some more custom festive stuff and config saving in the future, just wanted to get this functional version out so it seems like I do stuff.
