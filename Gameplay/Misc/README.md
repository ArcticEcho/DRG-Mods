## Good Old Bet-C.exe - v33.2.0
**Authors:** NaturalBornCamper  
**DRG Version:** Update 33, Hotfix 2  
**Download Link:** [Download](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-Mods/raw/b76ccc71de1d2cfc5ceaf69fa73bca1e70a287f6/Gameplay/Misc/Good%20Old%20Bet-C.exe%20-%20V33.2.0%20_P.pak)  

**Description:**  
Prevents friendly BET-C from hurling bombs in your face and taking out your shield.  
Basically uses Left 4 Dead AI principles; if not smart enough to avoid hitting you,  
then at least it won't damage you. Just like good old times before update 20-something.  
No more needing to re-consider repairing BET-C or not on shield disruption missions.

**Description:**  
**Requires the Mod Loader**  
--Adds three toggles in the mod loader to enable Christmas, Halloween and a custom map setup made by me.  
--Visually and audibly works as a client regardless of what the host has (I left this in on purpose, could disable it while not the host), all three options work well for clients while you are the host.  
--Good for snowball fights if you turn on my custom map edits (extra snow).  Will add some more custom festive stuff and config saving in the future, just wanted to get this functional version out so it seems like I do stuff.
